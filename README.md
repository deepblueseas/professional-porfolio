# Professional Portfolio

## Project Goal
-AS A new developer <br>
-MY GOAL was to create a portfolio <br>
-USING HTML and CSS <br>
-TO DISPLAY my contact info, resume, about me, and any current projects <br>
-THIS PAGE should be responsive and links working correctly <br>

## Reflections

### Successes
-I am getting more comfortable with css <br>
-The basic elements of the page are there <br>
-The page deployed properly <br>
-I am getting better at remembering to comment my CSS <br>

### Incompletions/Things to Finish
-I need to finish linking my contacts <br>
-The images in the Work article have not yet been formatted
    correctly.  I would like them to have a hover effect even if they
    don't link yet. And my git repos image should link to my GitHub 
    repos <br>
-README still needs images <br>
-The CSS is very messy and in progress <br>

### Overall
-I'm relatively happy with my progress, know what I need to work on, and will continue to work on this project after my shift tomorrow.
